I\u2019ve been using this shower gel a while and I really like it. It is pretty much unscented and leaves me feeling very clean. I particularly like using this for my sensitive skin and havent had any issues since using it. Good value for money and a good size [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
Love it very nice to apply to your sponge to have a shower for good and does not make your skin warm and nice and does not make your skin dry and very good and will recommend to everyone who need a bath shower [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
"This product leaves a lovely fragrance to your laundry. However, I hate the absolute arrogance of Unilever/Comfort to design a large, heavy bottle without incorporating a handle! When trying to pour it out holding it with one hand with the lid in the other it is most likely going to spill out all over your hand and the floor. So, I won't be buying it again.",2,Negative,Negative
"I was very sceptical about using this soap , but it\u2019s a little miracle ! From the first use on my face I could see a huge difference . Skin feels plump and moisturised , has a lovely glow . Now my daily staple ! Love it ! Thank you x",5,Positive,Positive
"After pouring a capful of this white gold into one's washing machine, you can expect spring-fresh clothes in no time. It doesn't matter if you cold wash a cardigan, thirty-degree that tie or boil your bikini - It'll clean them. Anyway, why are you looking at the reviews for a small bottle when you could double down on your dedication and buy the next size up? Get your Ylang Ylang on and hit the town.",5,Positive,Positive

Perfect for sensitive skin! The shower gel is both cleansing and refreshing without irritating my skin like various other gels. It also has a lovely fresh smell and contains great ingredients such as chamomile oil. I would definitely recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
"I love the smell of this shower gel, smell quite natural, not like the other brand that the fragrance is too strong for me. I feel quite refreshing after using this shower gel, my skin trend to be very dry, but this gel seems to be the right balance of cleansing and moisturising. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
"I\u2019ve been using this for around a week now, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s just a pretty standard shower gel. The smell is quite strange - it smells like cucumber in the bottle, but almost like tea on the skin. It is quite gentle on the skin, but ultimately I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty average.

"It is a very neutral product. It\u2019s cheap but you get what you pay for. The smell is niceish, but very natural. Not more special than any other standard shower gel.

I have very reactive skin because of eczema. I have found this shower gel calming and it does not aggravate my skin. I\u2019m pleased to see that there are fewer ingredients in it than similar products and no added perfume! It literally doesn\u2019t smell of anything. For me this is ideal and I\u2019m happy to have another brand of shower gel that I feel safe to use without risking a flare up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
Just as I expected from a simple product! Nice and gentle on my skin and you dont need to use tonnes of it so it lasts as expected. No complaints - nice consistent product and would definitely buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],4,Positive,Positive
"Really gentle and cleansing, not a very strong smell though. Kind on your skin and foams nicely, I had just hoped for more of a scent, bit this would great if you have sensitive or delicate skin.

I ve been using this for over 1 week now and I can say that is a great product. It has a subtle smell and it cleans very well. I would recommend this product. It is a very good shower gel. It also has an affordable price. 5 stars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
I use simple between other brands as my skin breaks out easily and gets very dry with some branded soaps/shower gels I like simple as this does not happen!Simple refreshing shower gel does exactly as it says gives you that clean feeling without irritation literally has no smell!

"I've bought this shower gel a few times whenever my skin is sensitive or reacting to another product. True to the Simple brand name, it's very neutral and does a great job of not irritating my skin further. If you're looking for something luxurious or highly scented, this isn't the shower gel for that, but it's a good everyday essential. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4,Positive,Positive
"I just love simple products as I know they are not harmful on my skin, I started using facial products and now started using the the shower gel too. It has a great soft smell and leaves my skin feeling really soft too.I would highly recommend their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
So I tend to use another soap free brand and I ended up trying this and it\u2019s so great. I suffer from reactions from soaps and dry skin and this is great but also I personally would probably use it on a baby\u2019s skin too. It also is fragrance free. It\u2019s great value for money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
"I love that this shower gel has no perfumes and things in it! Especially, as I am due to have a baby doing nd will be in the market for lots of these to avoid any post birth irritation!

Try them you will not be disappointed. Super soft skin with no residue. Very pleased.",5,Positive,Positive
"The mayonnaise would get 5 stars from me for taste but the container is style over substance. The squeezy bottle is, in itself, a genius idea but thats where it stops. It is too tall for the size of cap making it top heavy and unstable. Every bottle Ive ever put in my fridge has tumbled out. The cap is made of brittle plastic so it shatters as it hits the kitchen floor. Its like Groundhog Day each time it happens! Then, as other reviewers have commented, its impossible to get all the product out of the bottle. Surely this container is crying out for a design overhaul?",3,Negative,Neutral

"This is a decent everyday lotion with a clean light scent.

I loved the sweet smell of this body lotion. The cream is thick and it absorbs quickly into the skin. The bottle states that it has a non-greasy formula and I found that to be correct.

This lightly fragranced lotion dispenses easily from the bottle. I found it spread well across my skin and was absorbed quite quickly. It really seemed to work well on my dryer areas such as knees and elbows so I tried it on my feet also! This was a revelation to me as being quite thin it was absorbed very quickly which meant no need for bed socks nor me slipping all over the place all night and also it moisturised my feet really well. I am really impressed with this versatile lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
"We've been using this for months. It's a lovely product. I have dry skin and using it just twice a week helps to keep it under control.

"I like because it is unperfumed and that is vitally important from my little 'Bunny Rabbits'point of view...yes she likes things clean &Soft...hence this babysoft conditioner,but if there was a perfume stronger than hers there would be trouble..No body is offended by her naturual scent,living on fresh hay and eating rose petals you can imagine how beautiful her little Bunny self smells.Fake perfume would send her scent glands into overdrive and she would be compelled to mark everything.!!! So for that reason,this product passes thr Bunny test.Soft & unscented perfect,Mrs Bunny sez so !",5,Positive,Positive

Read a few post Amazon were selling these 38 washes and sending out larger ones so decided to order. They are small bottles has advertised.

The family loved this! The marshmallow is particularly good in it,5,Positive,Positive

I can't wait to take this on holiday with me and hydrate my skin after a day in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
"Winter is really taking its toll on my skin and this moisturiser has been wonderful. It soaks in fast, isn't greasy at all and has a really refreshing aloe scent as well. It does everything I need to and does it well. It's water based so probably not best for oily skin, but on my normal to dry it's doing great. I'm pretty sensitive too but this hasn't caused any problems. However, it also contains Palm Oil. Now, palm oil is a brilliant ingredient and does a lot of wonderful things. But at the moment, it's rarely ethically sourced and that's my only issue with this product. Unilever are a big big player and need to address this issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4,Positive,Positive
I have tried this product and was totally impressed with how soft it left my skin. Its refreshing to the touch as well as to smell. I suffer from dry skin and this has made such a difference.

"Many thanks to Ocado for this free trial product, which I got my husband to test out. It is a big bottle which should last quite a long time. Because itâ€™s a gel rather than a liquid this means it is easier to deal with. The fragrance is quite subtle but is definitely recognisable as cedarwood which is quite popular in menâ€™s bathing products.",4,Positive,Positive

"I received a tub of this to try. We had it for dessert after Sunday lunch and one tub was sufficient for all 4 of us. The children both loved it of course (and gave it a million stars out of 5) and particularly enjoyed counting how many chocolate fish they found. I thought it was a really nice chocolate ice cream with plenty of chocolate fish - much more than I expected - but didnt really think there was a lot of caramel or marshmallow content, which was a shame. I would, however, buy this product again.",5,Neutral,Positive

Everyone loved this. Will buy again.,5,Positive,Positive
"I've been using this moisturiser daily for 5+ years and it's always been great for the price. However a recent formula change means that it now stings slightly to apply, and has caused dermatitis to flare up around my eyes. I've compared the ingredients from before and think it's possibly due to the inclusion of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Dissapoiting as was always super reliable before, even for my picky skin. Hopefully they'll change the formula back otherwise I won't be buying it again",2,Negative,Negative

I recently developed eczema for the first time due to an allergic reaction. I would wake up several times during the night clawing at my arms and legs to stop the itching. While reading labels in the store I saw that this product was accepted by the National Eczema Association and decided to give it a try. By the next day the itching was tolerable. By the fifth day the redness and swelling were all but gone. Still using it every day and my skin feels better each day! Thank You!!!,5,Positive,Positive

Used this conditioner for years! Others often comment when taking washing out how nice it smells..but does not leave lingering fragrance like a perfume. Not chemically or overpowering like others. Does great job as a softener too. Notice when change brands or run out. 5 stars for the product but 1 star for price consistence here on amazon. As always Amazon has price fluctuation for many different reasons but this particulr item ranges from Â£5 to Â£10. Watch the price!! Can easily buy for Â£6 in shops when in stock. I never buy when costs more here.,5,Positive,Positive

It states that the wipes dont contain alcohol however, on the back in small writing I see that it says it uses Cetearyl alcohol which is still a form of alcohol. Apart from that, I would use them if I needed too and reccomend the product as an okay product to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4,Neutral,Positive

"I came across an article to use Vaseline on acne scars and irritated skin, so I tried it out. Never would I think to do this, I would think that this would clog my pores. However it did the opposite, I have been using this for a month now and it is life changing! My scars have visibly faded! I have gone to so many dermatologist and couldn2019t find any product that worked this well. This is a game changer my friends, please try it out!",5,Positive,Positive

I have been having a few problems with other makeup wipes recently as I am pregnant and my skin has become more sensitive leaving me with a bright red rash after removing makeup!

"I don2019t use alot of toning products as I do not like the cold and the wet immediate feeling on my skin. Also,because my skin is prone to blemishes! But this product really impressed me! The toner is very mild and gentle on my skin as it claims to be. It is very refreshing and gets well absorbed into the skin to clear the remains of any makeup left after cleansing. I do use a night cream and a serum after this but I can honestly say the toner has contributed in a much cleaner finish to my daily regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4,Positive,Positive
I tried this out for a week and have absolutely fallen in love with it. Removes the dirt and make up from my face and it doesn't make my skin feel sticky or dry (which many other toners do).

"So I2019m not usually a fan of wipes as they don2019t remove my makeup properly even when I2019ve gone over my face 3 times. However these wipes are brilliant, just using one wipe removed all of my makeup including waterproof mascara. It may be because of the micellar water that2019s in them. It2019s really good. They didn2019t break me out at all, didn2019t make my face feel sticky or sore. I am a convert, I 100% recommended these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive

"Surf Tropical Lily & Ylang Ylang is a fab laundry detergent â€“ awesome smell, brilliant cleaning power â€“ gets clothes bright clean, fresh even on cold washes. I love how it makes things smell, lasts for some time and great cleaning power on general stains like tea, deodorant marks, mud, spag bol so great for our family. Really easy to store, use and does. I have often rubbed a little into clothing if there is a particular stain like spag bol in case it needs a little more attention which works wonders even on whites! Really great value and having used it on delicate lingerie cottons, towels, silk dresses, man-made fiber clothing like work clothes, I have no complaints with general washing, highly recommend.",5,Positive,Positive

"I HATE HATE HATE the new pump. There seems to be no way to separate it from the bottle in order to get out the last of the lotion. Plus the new pump's opening is too big and clogs continually. If Vaseline does not fix this, I will have to find a new brand after 20 years of loyalty to this one. Shame on Vaseline for \""fixing\"" something that was never broken, all to get customers to purchase a new bottle sooner.",1,Negative,Negative

I2019ve tried using it for a week now, and just can2019t stand it any longer. I2019m guessing there2019s been a formula or ingredient supplier change? I hope you will bring back the old version.

"You really can't wrong with this deodorant; it not only smells nice, it also can last for weeks or months (depending how much you use of course) and for 3 cans this is a bargain.

"Time after time I return to this product. While it is designed probably for younger skin I am in my 50's with menopausal skin which is sometimes irritated and find that this cream helps to calm down excema , redness etc. On its own it does not reduce the wrinkles and crepey skin that come with aging but when layered and used in conjunction with hyaluronic based creams that are water based it makes a wonderful companion and does a good job of making my eyes look reasonable and ironing out some of the wrinkles and loss of firmness. It is easily absorbed , doesn't leave greasy skin so is great under make up. Can be used with day or night eye creams. Best of all it's a good price.",4,Positive,Positive

All the very small tubs and/or lip therapy, etc. come with an added color, flavor or something added besides 100% pure petroleum jelly which irritates my lips.Thank you for reading my concern & hopefully some day there will be \""pure vaseline\"" in a lip balm / tube.

"Helped my scalp so much but the price is ridiculous when you consider the amount you have to use per wash and that you must buy the conditioner too. Any other non gentle brand would last me 4 times longer than this. It feels like people with illness are being rinsed (no pun intended). It's a no go for really long hair. I will be looking into other cheaper alternatives but the product is great. It's helped with my husbands dermatitis and with my sore scalp. At first my hair went dry and was like hay, then it was switching back and forth from dry to greasy but after a few weeks it's looking healthier than ever. I'm wondering if it just takes time for your hair to get used to less stuff on it and to get back to more of its natural form if you know what I mean.My main advice would be to try it for 6 weeks minimum before you write it off as rubbish.My only other annoyance aside from the price is that it's very thin and runny. It's hard to stop it running down my hair then off down my back so 20% of the bottle just goes down the plug hole without ever washing my hair first.",4,Positive,Positive
"I've been using for some time - yes it may be gentle to the skin but it makes such a soggy mess in the soap dish unlike my old favourite, Lux. Had enough - planning to try to find something else.",3,Negative,Neutral

For the first time I bought this ice cream (as the reviews are so good)and try it. To be honest it\u2019s not that bad but not amazing. The vanilla yogurt from alpro is way better. My kids enjoyed but for me need to have more vanilla flavour. My husband smelled and says smell like a big blop of cream.,3,Neutral,Neutral

"Even when washing at 40 or 60deg, I still get remains of capsule in the washer and on clothing. On one occasion it was stuck in the washer's filter and triggered a fault light.

"I don't have the time or energy to apply proper fake tan on a regular basis so I use this a few times a week instead. I'm actually really pale so I find the one for pale skin takes ages to show any colour so I buy this one for darker skin and it gives a lovely colour a bit sooner. You've got to be careful not to treat it like a moisturizer and rub it in well. Be careful on the elbows, wrists, knees and feet like you would with regular tanner. Lasts a long time on the skin and doesn't wear off in patches!",5,Positive,Positive

"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",5,Positive,Positive

About two weeks after using this my bad cystic acne started to fade by the time i finished the bottle all my acne was gone.i thought i was just missing toner in my skin care so i started using a garnier one i had from a set .One week later my acne comes back so im back to using simple and my acne is fading again.i will never stop using this,5,Negative,Positive
"I bought this a couple of months ago along with the cleanser and moisturiser as i have spot prone, oily skin and occasional issues with dermatitis around my eyes. This was the worst mistake ever. I thought I was crazy as Simple is supposed to be gentle on the skin but after using this toner it has dried my skin out and bought the dermatitis back around my eyes so they are very red, the skin flaky and sore in places. At first i didn't think it was the toner but after two months of elimination it is definitely the toner drying out my skin. I would not recommend this product at all.",1,Negative,Negative

I had run out of washing liquid and fabric conditioner and wasnâ€™t able to get to the shops due to a broken ankle. I came across this bundle as decided to give it a try as I as desperate for washing stuff. This bundle is a brilliant buy and very good value for money. I would highly recommend. However the fabric conditioner did seem to clog up the drawer though - this has never happened with the normal fabric conditioner I use.,5,Positive,Positive

"Lotion works pretty good however 8 pumps into a 20.3 oz bottle and the 201Csmart pump201D stopped working. They2019ve designed the bottle so that you can2019t screw the pump off, like we2019ve all done in the past to get the last of the lotion out. I was determined to not loose a entire bottle of lotion so I had to cut the top off with a box knife. Word to the wise, advoid the smart pump!",3,Neutral,Neutral

Do NOT buy this or any other simple products as they have changed the preservatives in them. I have come out in a bad sore rash my eyes are burning and my top lip tingled I had to wash it all off! I phoned simple and she told me they have had a product change in all their stuff changing the preservatives!! When I asked WHY she just said I don't know it just changed. I want to know why!!?? There's no good reason except maybe for them to save money using cheaper ingredients!! I've used simple products for nearly 20 years since Nivea did the same and sold their company to a German company who changed all their products. Im really angry about this what am I supposed to use now. I have VERY sensitive skin and simple was ok but now it's rubbish! Im skin is sore burnt and simple just don't care!! Please be careful as I usually stock up when my products are on offer but fully Asda gave me a refund onto a gift card as I didn't have the receipt for the 6 bottles I had or I'd have been well out if pocket!!??,1,Negative,Negative

It's so quick and easy to apply. You can apply either morning or night and leave on - you'll see results quickly! So good to take away on holiday too to give you that extra summer glow and colour that's so easy to do! However... once you've finished applying, make sure you wash your hands or wipe your palms with a wet wipe. Also clean your nails thoroughly as the colour can stick there as you're using your hands to apply. Other than that, really recommends this product and it's such good value for money!",5,Positive,Positive

"After being caught out by the sudden nice weather and me still being as pale as an uncooked chip I bought a bottle of this to try. The very first time I used it, I did have a couple of streaks on my legs then I read the instructions and realised it says you must apply it in circles, so the next day I used a liberal amount and made sure to use a circular motion all over and I was delighted that on only the second day I had enough colour to go bare-legged (it had also covered up the streaks too)I have now applied this for 4 days running and look like I have been away for a week in the sun. It is a really natural even colour. There is a bit of a whiff of fake tan when you first apply it but it wears off after a few hours. My skins feels so smooth and moisturised too which is an added bonus!",5,Positive,Positive
"I've always longed for more of a healthy colour to my skin as I am extremely pale, but have been put off each time I have used a tanning product because- well, it's been disastrous. However! This is the first (and only) successful product that i have used which creates a beautifully even, healthy and natural tan within a few days.I could not rate this enough. I also have sensitive, spot-prone skin on my face but I have been able to use this on my face successfully as well. Long-lasting, deeply moisturising and super natural. 10/10 my favourite!",5,Positive,Positive
Ive been using this product for 3 days now. I have a natural tan from this. Easy to apply and i like this better than the bondi sands gradual tan. It does have a slight fake tan smell at first but this wears away. Very pleased,5,Positive,Positive

It's nice to see this is on offer as I wouldn't buy it for nearly Â£4 I'd go to savers instead and get it as it is normally Â£1.95.

I bought this because I am very fair and hide from sunshine. However this product felt good as a moisturizer however felt clingy and greazy after a few minutes. After 2 hours of waiting the cream remains sticky. Also no change in my skin colour. I am really disappointed. I advise not to buy this product.,2,Negative,Negative
"Purchased because it was on offer and my blindingly white legs needed a bit of help. I only wanted a gradual tanner because there is less chance of obvious streaks. It smelt nice on application, a light floral scent. However within a few hours it smelt stronger than actual full on fake tan - very unpleasant. I could also feel the cream sitting on my skin, not fully absorbed or dry. The actual tanning result was barely noticeable. I won't be buying again.",2,Negative,Negative
"Love this! I am fair haired, blue eyed, lily white skin older lady who burns to a crisp in the sun, when i uncover. Having just returned from holiday i wanted to at least look like i had a tan but it was very cold there. I bought this on offer and went for Fair - Med. The first time i put it on my arms all over sparingly i didnt really notice that much although there was definately something. Today i thought let me add a bit more after a my usual morning shower. I applied a bit more liberally over arms legs, and face. I have had comments today on what a lovely glow i have. It has developed nicely today. I have a sassy looking healthy bod and i feel good. Bought another tube and just ordered a few more whilst on offer. I hate sitting in the sun and burning (unless i am covered in P20 lotion) and this is a very safe way to get the bronze look. No streaks, easy to apply, doesnt stain hands, slight tan smell but not too much. I am hooked.",5,Positive,Positive

"I have been looking for a good face SPF for so long now, especially as the weather has started to improve, but i have always found them to be so expensice - I am so happy this is so inexpensive! I have oily skin and this doesn't make me greasy and it looks amazing under makeup, my makeup looks so much better when I have this on, my foundation goes on so smoothly and my pores are hardly visible! love love love this, really mosituring and good sun protection",5,Positive,Positive
"I started using Cerave's facial lotion a few months ago and since had constant breakouts which isn't the norm for me. Wanting to love the product, I persisted until very recently when I decided enough was enough. I picked up this Simple one and it's the best thing I've done. Within two days not only have my current spots begun to clear, the overall look of my face is so much calmer. Just goes to show that all the fancy, long named, sciencey products don't always come up on top over simple and gentle products like this one.",5,Positive,Positive

"okay, I have hair like most of us. for sure, less each year but that's only meant I care a bit more about doing right by it.

"Great fragrance that strikes just the right balance - although the wife complains that the small bottles are very difficult to pour accurately from. They probably are if you slurp in what you reckon is a full measure and, in fact, it is nearer two full measures. This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottleâ€¦.butâ€¦.if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to beâ€¦..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky â€“ if you know what such a thing smells like? Something else I really like about this conditioner is that the bottles are all made from recyclable plastic and the manufacturer is asking for customers to recycle the new bottles so they can go the same path third time around! Three Stars for the product and another one for being good and green.",4,Neutral,Positive
"Great price for these bottles, and you only need a small amount (half a cap) in the wash to soften clothes. The smell is nice but doesn't last - if you want something that lingers, try Lenor Unstoppables (but that won't soften clothes). That said, the softening effect is noticeable, even when handwashing delicate underwear. I like the ultra concentration which reduces the size of the bottles for storage.",4,Positive,Positive
This is an ultra concentrated fabric conditioner. I was initially surprised at how small the bottles were but then I read on the side that you only need half a cap of the product so each bottle will last you a while. It is nice to be able to fit the bottles in my kitchen cupboard! I did find that half a cap was enough. I live in an area with very hard water and my clothes came out of the wash feeling soft and smelling lovely. I did really like the scent although it is nothing special (it just had that generic floral fabric conditioner scent that they all have).,5,Positive,Positive
"Bought one of the smaller sized bottles of the same softener to compare quality and was disappointed to find this was much thinner than the kind you find in the shop. Has been heavily diluted so no real saving, will be going back to getting it in the shop and cancelling my subscription.",1,Negative,Negative

Love a pot noodle. Plenty of curry flavour. Brill as a snack anytime. Easy to prepare. Great value for money. Cheaper than the supermarkets. Definitely recommend,5,Positive,Positive
"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",5,Positive,Positive

"If I was a wild-eyed enthusiast and was asked to rate free Magnums as part of a promotion I'd perhaps err on the generous side. As a paying customer, however, these are nothing to write home about. There's an uncomfortable flavour clash, between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core, that's difficult to describe. The core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid, own brand raspberry ice-cream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other Magnums. It's almost as if they rushed the product development process and ended up with bitter raspberry ripple on a stick. So, so disappointing when you consider what these could have been.",2,Negative,Negative

"This pack of 8 bottles of laundry conditioner is really nice. The scent is indeed what marketers would call 'fresh' it smells nice, but I'm not sure it's what the sky smells of... As ever with conditioner, a little goes a long way, but this is concentrated so you need way way less, you get 36 washes in a bottle, so there's a lot of savings straight off the bat vs normal conditioner. Very nice, good little bottles, would recommend them.",5,Positive,Positive
You know what you are going to get with Comfort regarding the feel and smell post wash. These Super concentrated fabric conditioners smell great use much less plastic (which is 100% from recycled sources so they say). You only need to use a fraction of the ammount of liquid of the non concentrated variety for the same results. Happy to say that all the claims on the product seem to be true so if you like that traditional Comfort smell buy with confidence.,5,Positive,Positive
"I really like this - the scent is not overpowering and pleasant and it leaves clothes feeling softer. I particularly like the fact that the bottle is 100% recycled, and that there is a removable wrap around it so I can recycle again. The product being concentrated is a plus too, for storage and for ease of use. Easy to measure and use and great value too!",5,Positive,Positive

My daughter has really sensitive skin so whilst the rest of use can use any laundry products, we have to use non bio for her laundry. This bundle is good, it doesn't irritate her skin and smells lovely. I think this is good value, and great to have it on subscribe and save.....this kit could be delivered to your house the regularly and you can do laundry with little effort, whereas going to the shops and trawling around for laundry products on offer it such a faff. Great products, great scents, great job.",5,Positive,Positive

I have used this for washing both our clothing and that of the grandchildren. I have excema as does one of our grandchildren. These products did not irritate our condition at all and it nice to be able to wash everyone's clothing altogether rather than separately because of the excema. Both products smell fresh and clean although you get more washes in this pack than you do softener so you will need to buy more softener.,4,Positive,Positive

"Because the bottles are smaller and lighter, and I have a touch of stiffness in my hands I find these much easier to pick up and pour them than the traditional larger bottles, although I did have a bit of a struggle getting the lid off the first time. The scent is fresh, floral and pleasant, and not overpowering, and it lingers on washing well afterwards too. The bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way - A half capful is recommended for washes of 4-5 kg, and a full capful for larger washes. There are 36 washes based on the half capful dose for 4-5kg loads, so as I usually do larger loads I should get approximately 18 washes per bottle. The bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic and it can be recycled again, except for the plastic sleeve.",4,Positive,Positive

"These are 540ml bottles giving 36 wash loads of Fuchsia Passion fabric conditioner by Comfort. The bottles are entirely plastic, made from 100% recycled plastic and are 100% recyclable. The bottles have a narrow screw top, which is used as the measure, and the bottle has an accurate slim pourer â€“ no dribbles. This one is concentrated and needs only Â½ a capful for each washload. I've used Comfort on and off for many years and this Fuchsia Passion fragrance is a very nice, light floral fragrance. My towels and clothing all felt nice and soft after being washed and dried, and had a lovely smell of flowers with a hint of fruit â€“ mango? â€“ and freshly laundered clothing. It's not too strong or overpowering at all â€“ just a nice smell of just washed clothes.",5,Positive,Positive
"I got this on a deal for Â£9- amazing value for money, this pack has enough for 228 washes and a bottle for 60 washes is usually Â£5, so I basically saved Â£15??

"Clearly this latest product variation from Comfort is to address some environmental concerns and plastics waste. The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, slightly zesty aroma to your clothes. The scent will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.",5,Positive,Positive
"I usually use secret, which is the best by a country mile out of many, many anti perspirants I've tried over many years.

"Superb kit. The persil non-bio is great and we use it for all our clothes and other than really stubborn stains its great. One word of warning. Although it does say it handles a 30c wash, I tend to go at least 40 to ensure the gel has been thoroughly rinsed from the machine and clothes. A washing machine repair guy once told me 30 was a false economy especially if using gel as it can build up over time and cause issues. The comfort is really nice.
