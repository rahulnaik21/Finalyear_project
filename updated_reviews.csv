"I suffer with dry sensitive skin and vaseline is one of very few products that doesn't make my skin flare up and itch like crazy!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful fresh smell that escaped as I lifted the cap, as I applied a drop to my skin I instantly felt a soothing relief and easily moisturised into my skin absorbing effortlessly and not at all greasy unlike alot of other moisturisers I've tried! I use this product every day and it has improved my dry skin condition massively couldn't recommend this product enough I absolutely love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
Absolutely love this stuff ... leaves a lovely lingering fragrance that you can smell each time you open a wardrobe or clothes drawer ... gets everything clean really well too Reminds me of when I was a kid and Mum just put me in some freshly laundered clothes ... lovely,5,Positive,Positive

"Have used a lot of make-up brands and in the past bought their more expensive make-up remover products, but none have ever removed mascara, eye-shadow, foundation bases etc as gently and as well as Simple Cleansing Lotion. Its consistency is not runny, you have to squeeze the bottle appropriately onto the cotton wool, which is ideal for controlling how much is dispensed. Also great for tidying up eyeliner or mascara errors when applied sparsely on a cotton wool bud. Always keep this now in my bathroom cabinet. Why pay more?",5,Positive,Positive
not sure why the big jar costs more than double this size though!,5,Neutral,Positive

"I've been Using tresemme products for years. Previously the regular heat protection but after being recommended this one for colour treated hair gave it a go and Ive not looked back! Leaves my hair with a lovely shine, ive got dyed red hair so it can be hard to keep looking healthy. Seems to do a Good job with heat protection too. I only dry my hair, no straighteners or tongs but seems to keep the damage away",5,Positive,Positive

"This is a good deodorant if you have easily irritated skin. It's like Dove soap in that it doesn't seem to irritate or dry out skin. I've used Dove soaps for quite a long time and this is certainly something which they are good for, this seems to be as good as all of them. It's main selling point, beyond being an effective 24 hour deodorant, is that it is not prone to marking your clothes. It certainly seems to work as far as that goes too, though we haven't been able to test on every single colour. Good though. Recommended.",5,Positive,Positive

"This is my favourite scent from the intense range, smells lovely and lasts ages on my clothes. I do use more than the recommended amount otherwise the scent isn’t very strong, so it definitely doesn’t do 64 washes, probably half that.",4,Positive,Positive
I find these to be the best for my laundry and a part of that includes only using one - not over dosing like I do with liquid or powders. smells great and washes well.,5,Positive,Positive

"We all crave things that transport us back to more innocent times. For me Bovril is one of those things, from the gooey unctuousness of the tar black bovril overflowing from the spoon to the ""ding ding ding"" as I stir it in hot water to make it dissolve and the earthy, beefy smell with hints of celery and goodness knows what else. Sometimes you can get alcohol fatigue so Bovril is a great alternative to a nightcap or even mug of tea. I even go so far as to dissolve a pat of butter in it too for extra richness and within an hour I'm pretty much knocked out and sleep soundly until morning, warm and comforted. This pack will last me a long time I am sure, certainly 2 winters.",5,Positive,Positive

The price of this bulk pack is less than buying the items individually from somewhere else. I won't use any other shampoo because they tend to dry my hair and I don't like using a lot of chemicals. This product is perfect as it contains nothing and keeps me dandruff free. Even anti-dandruff shampoo doesn't always work I've found in the past.,5,Positive,Positive

I’ve both exact a similar 5 litre one from Costco before which thick and smelt lovely similar to regular sized ones from the supermarkets so I don’t think large quantity is the issue here. This one from Amazon is very runny as if it’s been diluted and doesn’t smell or soften clothes same. This may be fake I’m thinking. Really curious if bad batch or if amazon is not sourcing genuine product. Very baffled.,1,Negative,Negative

"While I like the product, the bottle is unsuitable. The plastic is very thin, which is a good thing, and this means it almost impossible to pick up the bottle and fill the very small cap without spilling a significant amount, especially when the bottle is still relatively full. Do buy this, but only if you are happy to decant the content into a sturdier bottle.",1,Negative,Negative
I love lynx products so was happy to buy this to write a review. I am female but I like the scent of mens products and I think the scent stays longer on the skin. Nice consistency too so you don't lose it off your hands and down the plughole!,5,Positive,Positive

"I bulk bought these as don't drive and they are heavy to carry from the supermarket. Scent is good, supposed to last 64 washes. This is only if you use half lidfulls. If your like me you'll throw in a full cap and it won't last as long.",5,Neutral,Positive

I have very reactive skin because of eczema. I have found this shower gel calming and it does not aggravate my skin.

For me this is ideal and I\u2019m happy to have another brand of shower gel that I feel safe to use without risking a flare up.

I use simple between other brands as my skin breaks out easily and gets very dry with some branded soaps/shower gels I like simple as this does not happen!Simple refreshing shower gel does exactly as it says gives you that clean feeling without irritation literally has no smell! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],3,Positive,Neutral
"I've bought this shower gel a few times whenever my skin is sensitive or reacting to another product. True to the Simple brand name, it's very neutral and does a great job of not irritating my skin further. If you're looking for something luxurious or highly scented, this isn't the shower gel for that, but it's a good everyday essential. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4,Positive,Positive
"I just love simple products as I know they are not harmful on my skin, I started using facial products and now started using the the shower gel too. It has a great soft smell and leaves my skin feeling really soft too.I would highly recommend their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
So I tend to use another soap free brand and I ended up trying this and it\u2019s so great. I suffer from reactions from soaps and dry skin and this is great but also I personally would probably use it on a baby\u2019s skin too. It also is fragrance free. It\u2019s great value for money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
"I love that this shower gel has no perfumes and things in it! Especially, as I am due to have a baby doing nd will be in the market for lots of these to avoid any post birth irritation!

"I picked up in a rush in store and am so pleased I did. These remove make up with ease and leave my skin feeling tighter and brighter. I use both sides of the wipe and it remains strong and moist. I usually use micellar water but will continue to use these because they are just so good. No overpowering scent, no perfume or colour. Excellent quality and immediate results. Try them you will not be disappointed. Super soft skin with no residue. Very pleased.",5,Positive,Positive
"The mayonnaise would get 5 stars from me for taste but the container is style over substance. The squeezy bottle is, in itself, a genius idea but thats where it stops. It is too tall for the size of cap making it top heavy and unstable. Every bottle Ive ever put in my fridge has tumbled out. The cap is made of brittle plastic so it shatters as it hits the kitchen floor. Its like Groundhog Day each time it happens! Then, as other reviewers have commented, its impossible to get all the product out of the bottle. Surely this container is crying out for a design overhaul?",3,Negative,Neutral
This ice cream is great. The cookie dough pieces are just the right size and the ice cream itself is so creamy and delicious. The only problem is that once you open the tub it's impossible to stop eating until it's all gone.,5,Positive,Positive

"This is a decent everyday lotion with a clean light scent.

I loved the sweet smell of this body lotion. The cream is thick and it absorbs quickly into the skin. The bottle states that it has a non-greasy formula and I found that to be correct.

"I use body lotion but had never tried the Vaseline ones before. I wish I had! It has such a pleasant fragrance and leaves my skin so soft and nourished after showering.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
This lightly fragranced lotion dispenses easily from the bottle. I found it spread well across my skin and was absorbed quite quickly. It really seemed to work well on my dryer areas such as knees and elbows so I tried it on my feet also! This was a revelation to me as being quite thin it was absorbed very quickly which meant no need for bed socks nor me slipping all over the place all night and also it moisturised my feet really well. I am really impressed with this versatile lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive
"We've been using this for months. It's a lovely product. I have dry skin and using it just twice a week helps to keep it under control.

It doesn't leave any stickiness or residue like some products do! We love this product a lot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive

"I suffer with dry sensitive skin and vaseline is one of very few products that doesn't make my skin flare up and itch like crazy!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful fresh smell that escaped as I lifted the cap, as I applied a drop to my skin I instantly felt a soothing relief and easily moisturised into my skin absorbing effortlessly and not at all greasy unlike alot of other moisturisers I've tried!

This time of year my skin tends to become dry and itchy. Within just a few days of using Vaseline Intensive Care aloe soothe my skin feels so much better.

It definitely delivers what it claims in terms of calming and healing dry skin. I would highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],5,Positive,Positive

I didn’t read the about details correctly. It’s 6 small bottles totalling 3.6 litres. Expensive for that quantity when a 1.9lt bottle is only £2.99,5,Negative,Positive
Read a few post Amazon were selling these 38 washes and sending out larger ones so decided to order. They are small bottles has advertised. Not sure they're worth £2 a bottle shops are selling larger ones for 50p extra. Lovely spell don't use any other fabric softer you only need a little amount.,4,Positive,Positive

The family loved this! The marshmallow is particularly good in it,5,Positive,Positive

I can't wait to take this on holiday with me and hydrate my skin after a day in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive
"Winter is really taking its toll on my skin and this moisturiser has been wonderful. It soaks in fast, isn't greasy at all and has a really refreshing aloe scent as well. It does everything I need to and does it well. It's water based so probably not best for oily skin, but on my normal to dry it's doing great. I'm pretty sensitive too but this hasn't caused any problems. However, it also contains Palm Oil. Now, palm oil is a brilliant ingredient and does a lot of wonderful things. But at the moment, it's rarely ethically sourced and that's my only issue with this product. Unilever are a big big player and need to address this issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",4,Positive,Positive
I have tried this product and was totally impressed with how soft it left my skin. Its refreshing to the touch as well as to smell. I suffer from dry skin and this has made such a difference.

Decidedly smaller than a normal Magnums and the raspberry Newsweek the two layers of chocolate is too sweet and too much quantity.,3,Negative,Neutral

"Many thanks to Ocado for this free trial product, which I got my husband to test out. It is a big bottle which should last quite a long time. Because it’s a gel rather than a liquid this means it is easier to deal with. The fragrance is quite subtle but is definitely recognisable as cedarwood which is quite popular in men’s bathing products.",4,Positive,Positive
I wouldnt normally choose chocolate ice cream and my husband isnt a fan either however he was quite taken with this and I think the tub will disappear quickly!,4,Neutral,Positive
"I received a tub of this to try. We had it for dessert after Sunday lunch and one tub was sufficient for all 4 of us. The children both loved it of course (and gave it a million stars out of 5) and particularly enjoyed counting how many chocolate fish they found. I thought it was a really nice chocolate ice cream with plenty of chocolate fish - much more than I expected - but didnt really think there was a lot of caramel or marshmallow content, which was a shame. I would, however, buy this product again.",5,Neutral,Positive

"I've been using this moisturiser daily for 5+ years and it's always been great for the price. However a recent formula change means that it now stings slightly to apply, and has caused dermatitis to flare up around my eyes. I've compared the ingredients from before and think it's possibly due to the inclusion of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Dissapoiting as was always super reliable before, even for my picky skin. Hopefully they'll change the formula back otherwise I won't be buying it again",2,Negative,Negative

I recently developed eczema for the first time due to an allergic reaction. I would wake up several times during the night clawing at my arms and legs to stop the itching. While reading labels in the store I saw that this product was accepted by the National Eczema Association and decided to give it a try. By the next day the itching was tolerable. By the fifth day the redness and swelling were all but gone. Still using it every day and my skin feels better each day! Thank You!!!,5,Positive,Positive

Used this conditioner for years! Others often comment when taking washing out how nice it smells..but does not leave lingering fragrance like a perfume. Not chemically or overpowering like others. Does great job as a softener too. Notice when change brands or run out. 5 stars for the product but 1 star for price consistence here on amazon. As always Amazon has price fluctuation for many different reasons but this particulr item ranges from £5 to £10. Watch the price!! Can easily buy for £6 in shops when in stock. I never buy when costs more here.,5,Positive,Positive

"I don2019t use alot of toning products as I do not like the cold and the wet immediate feeling on my skin. Also,because my skin is prone to blemishes! But this product really impressed me! The toner is very mild and gentle on my skin as it claims to be. It is very refreshing and gets well absorbed into the skin to clear the remains of any makeup left after cleansing. I do use a night cream and a serum after this but I can honestly say the toner has contributed in a much cleaner finish to my daily regime.

I tried this out for a week and have absolutely fallen in love with it. Removes the dirt and make up from my face and it doesn't make my skin feel sticky or dry (which many other toners do).

"So I2019m not usually a fan of wipes as they don2019t remove my makeup properly even when I2019ve gone over my face 3 times. However these wipes are brilliant, just using one wipe removed all of my makeup including waterproof mascara. It may be because of the micellar water that2019s in them. It2019s really good. They didn2019t break me out at all, didn2019t make my face feel sticky or sore. I am a convert, I 100% recommended these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",5,Positive,Positive

"Surf Tropical Lily & Ylang Ylang is a fab laundry detergent – awesome smell, brilliant cleaning power – gets clothes bright clean, fresh even on cold washes. I love how it makes things smell, lasts for some time and great cleaning power on general stains like tea, deodorant marks, mud, spag bol so great for our family. Really easy to store, use and does. I have often rubbed a little into clothing if there is a particular stain like spag bol in case it needs a little more attention which works wonders even on whites! Really great value and having used it on delicate lingerie cottons, towels, silk dresses, man-made fiber clothing like work clothes, I have no complaints with general washing, highly recommend.",5,Positive,Positive

"I HATE HATE HATE the new pump. There seems to be no way to separate it from the bottle in order to get out the last of the lotion. Plus the new pump's opening is too big and clogs continually. If Vaseline does not fix this, I will have to find a new brand after 20 years of loyalty to this one. Shame on Vaseline for \""fixing\"" something that was never broken, all to get customers to purchase a new bottle sooner.",1,Negative,Negative

I found these wipes to be too dry to effectively remove my makeup. A double cleanse is definitely required with these. Removing eye makeup with these wipes was a struggle.

"I have used Vaseline on my lips for well over 20 years and loved it. I buy a large jar of plain Vaseline and use on my lips. I loved that there is really no smell or taste to it. BUT last week, I bought a new jar, put some on, and it has a taste that I can only explain of tasting like black oil that goes into a car. It is terrible! I2019ve tried using it for a week now, and just can2019t stand it any longer. I2019m guessing there2019s been a formula or ingredient supplier change? I hope you will bring back the old version.

"You really can't wrong with this deodorant; it not only smells nice, it also can last for weeks or months (depending how much you use of course) and for 3 cans this is a bargain.

Stops my hair from drying out too much, a good protector.",4,Positive,Positive

"Time after time I return to this product. While it is designed probably for younger skin I am in my 50's with menopausal skin which is sometimes irritated and find that this cream helps to calm down excema , redness etc. On its own it does not reduce the wrinkles and crepey skin that come with aging but when layered and used in conjunction with hyaluronic based creams that are water based it makes a wonderful companion and does a good job of making my eyes look reasonable and ironing out some of the wrinkles and loss of firmness. It is easily absorbed , doesn't leave greasy skin so is great under make up. Can be used with day or night eye creams. Best of all it's a good price.",4,Positive,Positive

All the very small tubs and/or lip therapy, etc. come with an added color, flavor or something added besides 100% pure petroleum jelly which irritates my lips.Thank you for reading my concern & hopefully some day there will be \""pure vaseline\"" in a lip balm / tube.

"Helped my scalp so much but the price is ridiculous when you consider the amount you have to use per wash and that you must buy the conditioner too. Any other non gentle brand would last me 4 times longer than this. It feels like people with illness are being rinsed (no pun intended). It's a no go for really long hair. I will be looking into other cheaper alternatives but the product is great. It's helped with my husbands dermatitis and with my sore scalp. At first my hair went dry and was like hay, then it was switching back and forth from dry to greasy but after a few weeks it's looking healthier than ever. I'm wondering if it just takes time for your hair to get used to less stuff on it and to get back to more of its natural form if you know what I mean.My main advice would be to try it for 6 weeks minimum before you write it off as rubbish.My only other annoyance aside from the price is that it's very thin and runny. It's hard to stop it running down my hair then off down my back so 20% of the bottle just goes down the plug hole without ever washing my hair first.",4,Positive,Positive
"I've been using for some time - yes it may be gentle to the skin but it makes such a soggy mess in the soap dish unlike my old favourite, Lux. Had enough - planning to try to find something else.",3,Negative,Neutral

"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",5,Positive,Positive

Not my cup of tea but the old man loves them so they have to be a 5* because he has at least 2 every week at lunch time. They make a nice convenient lunch and he likes the flavour.

About two weeks after using this my bad cystic acne started to fade by the time i finished the bottle all my acne was gone.i thought i was just missing toner in my skin care so i started using a garnier one i had from a set .One week later my acne comes back so im back to using simple and my acne is fading again.i will never stop using this,5,Negative,Positive
"I bought this a couple of months ago along with the cleanser and moisturiser as i have spot prone, oily skin and occasional issues with dermatitis around my eyes. This was the worst mistake ever. I thought I was crazy as Simple is supposed to be gentle on the skin but after using this toner it has dried my skin out and bought the dermatitis back around my eyes so they are very red, the skin flaky and sore in places. At first i didn't think it was the toner but after two months of elimination it is definitely the toner drying out my skin. I would not recommend this product at all.",1,Negative,Negative

Do NOT buy this or any other simple products as they have changed the preservatives in them. I have come out in a bad sore rash my eyes are burning and my top lip tingled I had to wash it all off! I phoned simple and she told me they have had a product change in all their stuff changing the preservatives!! When I asked WHY she just said I don't know it just changed. I want to know why!!?? There's no good reason except maybe for them to save money using cheaper ingredients!! I've used simple products for nearly 20 years since Nivea did the same and sold their company to a German company who changed all their products. Im really angry about this what am I supposed to use now. I have VERY sensitive skin and simple was ok but now it's rubbish! Im skin is sore burnt and simple just don't care!! Please be careful as I usually stock up when my products are on offer but fully Asda gave me a refund onto a gift card as I didn't have the receipt for the 6 bottles I had or I'd have been well out if pocket!!??,1,Negative,Negative

"I bought this today as my mother has banned tan in my house so thought I could be sneaky and purchase a moisturiser/tan all in one. When I applied it seemed a bit sticky, but just thought it would sink in after a bit of time. When I woke up in the morning the tan hadn't sunk in at all and still felt tacky. The colour of the tan is really natural and gives a healthy glow and doesn't smell, easy for a last minute night out.",3,Positive,Neutral

"Can't go wrong for the price! I often use this alongside fake tan to sustain the colour and my skin often gets dry after applying fake tan so this helps to keep it hydrated! It's so quick and easy to apply. You can apply either morning or night and leave on - you'll see results quickly! So good to take away on holiday too to give you that extra summer glow and colour that's so easy to do! However... once you've finished applying, make sure you wash your hands or wipe your palms with a wet wipe. Also clean your nails thoroughly as the colour can stick there as you're using your hands to apply. Other than that, really recommends this product and it's such good value for money!",5,Positive,Positive

For the first time I bought this ice cream (as the reviews are so good)and try it. To be honest it’s not that bad but not amazing. The vanilla yogurt from alpro is way better.

"After being caught out by the sudden nice weather and me still being as pale as an uncooked chip I bought a bottle of this to try. The very first time I used it, I did have a couple of streaks on my legs then I read the instructions and realised it says you must apply it in circles, so the next day I used a liberal amount and made sure to use a circular motion all over and I was delighted that on only the second day I had enough colour to go bare-legged (it had also covered up the streaks too)I have now applied this for 4 days running and look like I have been away for a week in the sun. It is a really natural even colour. There is a bit of a whiff of fake tan when you first apply it but it wears off after a few hours. My skins feels so smooth and moisturised too which is an added bonus!",5,Positive,Positive
"I've always longed for more of a healthy colour to my skin as I am extremely pale, but have been put off each time I have used a tanning product because- well, it's been disastrous. However! This is the first (and only) successful product that i have used which creates a beautifully even, healthy and natural tan within a few days.I could not rate this enough. I also have sensitive, spot-prone skin on my face but I have been able to use this on my face successfully as well. Long-lasting, deeply moisturising and super natural. 10/10 my favourite!",5,Positive,Positive
Ive been using this product for 3 days now. I have a natural tan from this. Easy to apply and i like this better than the bondi sands gradual tan. It does have a slight fake tan smell at first but this wears away. Very pleased,5,Positive,Positive

Honestly now, I just can't live without it. I always have to buy this scent. It's my signature haha. It's nice to see this is on offer as I wouldn't buy it for nearly £4 I'd go to savers instead and get it as it is normally £1.95. Overall, buy it, smell it, pamper yourself and if you love baths you can get this scent in dove bubble bath too. Hehehe. Enjoy!",5,Positive,Positive

I bought this because I am very fair and hide from sunshine. However this product felt good as a moisturizer however felt clingy and greazy after a few minutes. After 2 hours of waiting the cream remains sticky. Also no change in my skin colour. I am really disappointed. I advise not to buy this product.,2,Negative,Negative
"Purchased because it was on offer and my blindingly white legs needed a bit of help. I only wanted a gradual tanner because there is less chance of obvious streaks. It smelt nice on application, a light floral scent. However within a few hours it smelt stronger than actual full on fake tan - very unpleasant. I could also feel the cream sitting on my skin, not fully absorbed or dry. The actual tanning result was barely noticeable. I won't be buying again.",2,Negative,Negative
"Love this! I am fair haired, blue eyed, lily white skin older lady who burns to a crisp in the sun, when i uncover. Having just returned from holiday i wanted to at least look like i had a tan but it was very cold there. I bought this on offer and went for Fair - Med. The first time i put it on my arms all over sparingly i didnt really notice that much although there was definately something. Today i thought let me add a bit more after a my usual morning shower. I applied a bit more liberally over arms legs, and face. I have had comments today on what a lovely glow i have. It has developed nicely today. I have a sassy looking healthy bod and i feel good. Bought another tube and just ordered a few more whilst on offer. I hate sitting in the sun and burning (unless i am covered in P20 lotion) and this is a very safe way to get the bronze look. No streaks, easy to apply, doesnt stain hands, slight tan smell but not too much. I am hooked.",5,Positive,Positive

"I started using Cerave's facial lotion a few months ago and since had constant breakouts which isn't the norm for me. Wanting to love the product, I persisted until very recently when I decided enough was enough. I picked up this Simple one and it's the best thing I've done. Within two days not only have my current spots begun to clear, the overall look of my face is so much calmer. Just goes to show that all the fancy, long named, sciencey products don't always come up on top over simple and gentle products like this one.",5,Positive,Positive

"okay, I have hair like most of us. for sure, less each year but that's only meant I care a bit more about doing right by it.

"Great fragrance that strikes just the right balance - although the wife complains that the small bottles are very difficult to pour accurately from. They probably are if you slurp in what you reckon is a full measure and, in fact, it is nearer two full measures. This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottle….but….if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to be…..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky – if you know what such a thing smells like? Something else I really like about this conditioner is that the bottles are all made from recyclable plastic and the manufacturer is asking for customers to recycle the new bottles so they can go the same path third time around! Three Stars for the product and another one for being good and green.",4,Neutral,Positive
"Great price for these bottles, and you only need a small amount (half a cap) in the wash to soften clothes. The smell is nice but doesn't last - if you want something that lingers, try Lenor Unstoppables (but that won't soften clothes). That said, the softening effect is noticeable, even when handwashing delicate underwear. I like the ultra concentration which reduces the size of the bottles for storage.",4,Positive,Positive
This is an ultra concentrated fabric conditioner. I was initially surprised at how small the bottles were but then I read on the side that you only need half a cap of the product so each bottle will last you a while. It is nice to be able to fit the bottles in my kitchen cupboard! I did find that half a cap was enough. I live in an area with very hard water and my clothes came out of the wash feeling soft and smelling lovely. I did really like the scent although it is nothing special (it just had that generic floral fabric conditioner scent that they all have).,5,Positive,Positive

"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",5,Positive,Positive

"If I was a wild-eyed enthusiast and was asked to rate free Magnums as part of a promotion I'd perhaps err on the generous side. As a paying customer, however, these are nothing to write home about. There's an uncomfortable flavour clash, between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core, that's difficult to describe. The core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid, own brand raspberry ice-cream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other Magnums. It's almost as if they rushed the product development process and ended up with bitter raspberry ripple on a stick. So, so disappointing when you consider what these could have been.",2,Negative,Negative

"This pack of 8 bottles of laundry conditioner is really nice. The scent is indeed what marketers would call 'fresh' it smells nice, but I'm not sure it's what the sky smells of... As ever with conditioner, a little goes a long way, but this is concentrated so you need way way less, you get 36 washes in a bottle, so there's a lot of savings straight off the bat vs normal conditioner. Very nice, good little bottles, would recommend them.",5,Positive,Positive
You know what you are going to get with Comfort regarding the feel and smell post wash. These Super concentrated fabric conditioners smell great use much less plastic (which is 100% from recycled sources so they say). You only need to use a fraction of the ammount of liquid of the non concentrated variety for the same results. Happy to say that all the claims on the product seem to be true so if you like that traditional Comfort smell buy with confidence.,5,Positive,Positive
"I really like this - the scent is not overpowering and pleasant and it leaves clothes feeling softer. I particularly like the fact that the bottle is 100% recycled, and that there is a removable wrap around it so I can recycle again.

This bundle is good, it doesn't irritate her skin and smells lovely. I think this is good value, and great to have it on subscribe and save.....this kit could be delivered to your house the regularly and you can do laundry with little effort, whereas going to the shops and trawling around for laundry products on offer it such a faff.

I have used this for washing both our clothing and that of the grandchildren. I have excema as does one of our grandchildren.

"Because the bottles are smaller and lighter, and I have a touch of stiffness in my hands I find these much easier to pick up and pour them than the traditional larger bottles, although I did have a bit of a struggle getting the lid off the first time. The scent is fresh, floral and pleasant, and not overpowering, and it lingers on washing well afterwards too. The bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way - A half capful is recommended for washes of 4-5 kg, and a full capful for larger washes. There are 36 washes based on the half capful dose for 4-5kg loads, so as I usually do larger loads I should get approximately 18 washes per bottle. The bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic and it can be recycled again, except for the plastic sleeve.",4,Positive,Positive

"These are 540ml bottles giving 36 wash loads of Fuchsia Passion fabric conditioner by Comfort. The bottles are entirely plastic, made from 100% recycled plastic and are 100% recyclable. The bottles have a narrow screw top, which is used as the measure, and the bottle has an accurate slim pourer – no dribbles. This one is concentrated and needs only ½ a capful for each washload. I've used Comfort on and off for many years and this Fuchsia Passion fragrance is a very nice, light floral fragrance. My towels and clothing all felt nice and soft after being washed and dried, and had a lovely smell of flowers with a hint of fruit – mango? – and freshly laundered clothing. It's not too strong or overpowering at all – just a nice smell of just washed clothes.",5,Positive,Positive

Although it does say it handles a 30c wash, I tend to go at least 40 to ensure the gel has been thoroughly rinsed from the machine and clothes. A washing machine repair guy once told me 30 was a false economy especially if using gel as it can build up over time and cause issues. The comfort is really nice.

"It's great that a lot of effort has been made to reduce the plastic needed for this product and by making the softener more concentrated less of that is needed too, though I see some buyers say they're still using the same amount they're used to doing with the larger bottles. This probably explains why there is so much said on the label explaining that a little goes a long way with this product. I have the fuchsia perfume version which smells OK and isn't overpowering. This is a big plus for me as I have had difficulty with the intensely perfumed products in the past. Note that the outer plastic sleeve isn't recyclable, so this needs to be disposed of separately.",4,Positive,Positive

"I was asked if I’d like to review Comfort Intense Fabric Conditioner Liquid, Fuchsia Passion, 540 ml, 216 Wash, Pack of 8, and I said yes. This has a lovely fragrance and gives your wash a lovely outside fresh fragrance. Be warned they are small bottles but the fabric conditioner is ultra-concentrated, so a little goes a long way. It’s nice to see that this bottle is made of 100% recycled plastic. In addition, the company state that it’s “saving 34% plastic, releasing 24% less waste and 20% less greenhouse gases compared to Comfort Blue Skies,” so it’s a winner for everyone that wants to help the environment.",5,Positive,Positive

"Ultra concentrate so you don't have to use as much, just half a cap full will do just fine. The scent has a nice floral smell, but as it's concentrated, if you are having a sniff test direct from the bottom, it will of course seem a bit too intense. The end result is a bunch of nicely scented clothes (scents/smells are always subjective). As for the bottle, it's made from 100% recycled plastic and all but the outer sleeve can be recycled, which is a great step forward. A thumbs up from me.",5,Positive,Positive

"The hype attached to the scent of fabric conditioner is something as a family we ignore. All we want is for the clothes to smell fresh and pleasant after a wash, to be soft and comfortable to wear and for the product to be economical. Fortunately, this one fulfills all the criteria. When I say 'to smell fresh and pleasant' I don't mean stink the place out with the scent and overpower and wilt everything in a 100 yard radius. Again, fortunately, this doesn't do so and so gets a general thumbs up, but I could have done without the wording bigging up the wonderfulness of the smells. To me that's an alarm call not to purchase! I'll whisk myself away with my own favourite perfumes. I don't want my clothes having a big-smell life of their own!",5,Negative,Positive

"These are gentle, skin-kind versions within the Persil and Comfort ranges. The bundled pack is a practical suggestion that offers good value compared to the individual retail prices of 2x25 wash Persil and 1x38 wash Comfort, making the fabric softener effectively free. I can't remember not using Persil non-biological as my laundry detergent of choice, it's the brand I grew up with - one that doesn't irritate the eczema and allergy prone skin of several members of my family. It has a pleasant, but not overly dominant scent, and the fluid formulation means this can be used even on cold washes. The Comfort is a highly concentrated version in quite a small bottle. In real life, the bottle is rather smaller than the product photo makes it appear in relation to the Persil, but this doesn't represent poor value (38 washes worth is 38 washes worth regardless of the size container in which it comes) and the small size does a good job of keeping the use of packaging materials down.",5,Positive,Positive

"I used Persil non-bio for many years, but changed to a brand specifically for babies about eight years ago, so it was a bit of a homecoming using it again. I really like the flip-top opening and how smoothly the product pours into the dispenser ball, which is much easier than the crosscut design on my usual brand that requires a fair amount of pressure. I never had a problem with how well Persil cleans, and this hasn’t changed; a machine load of baby clothes – together with stains - muslins and bedding came out spotless. With the addition of the Comfort Pure conditioner, the laundry was very soft and smelled lovely. It also performs well on general washing. I have decided to go back to using Persil non-bio; not just for the frustration-free dispenser, but it performs so well and is kind to skin. Using it again has made me wonder why I ever left the brand in the first place.",5,Positive,Positive

"At the current price, this works out at about 7.5p per wash, which considering the price of own label fabric conditioner is good value. Okay, you have to buy a box of it, but, if you have enough storage space, it's the way to go. It has a pleasant scent and it's a good size, though in this house we've been used to bigger bottles. The claim is it has 36 washes per bottle but that's using the recommended 1/2 cap, but I have to admit we've been using slightly more than that. Okay, that own label stuff will be cheaper and does come in a larger size but you do tend to have to use a bit more each wash.",5,Positive,Positive
Bulk buying this Intense version of this seems the only way to get true value for money unless you spot a deal. If you follow the on the bottle instructions the half a cap measure is enough to get the job done properly. The scent is lovely and really seems to last well even after some time after washing. Pleased overall just would probably get standard Comfort as a default and this as an on offer treat. Perhaps even better as the bigger bottles to get more for your money.,3,Positive,Neutral

My big baby is 32 but still has really sensitive skin - both his sons also have sensitive skin so I only use Persil non-bio when they are visiting. I have never found a fabric conditioner which has been certified by the British Skin Foundation before but Comfort Pure is - excellent! As the family were due to visit last week I freshly laundered the bedding and it washed well and felt nice and soft. There is a subtle scent which is very pleasant. This set of 3 products is great value at £11. Highly recommend product.,5,Positive,Positive

This is my 3rd time ordering this shampoo. It smells good and the content of the bottle is not too thick or too liquidy it feels like velvet actually. After I use it my hair feels softer which is why I chose this Shampoo for.,5,Positive,Positive
"Currently selling at a price comparable to that of supermarkets, this product is good - the smell is pleasant, and you only need to add a small amount to get your clothes smelling fresh again.",4,Positive,Positive
Great convenient product much easier that powder or liquid,5,Positive,Positive
I barely get 30 washes out if this. Not value for money at all.,2,Negative,Negative
"Great price for the number of washes you get. Has the added bonus of me not having to carry these heavy packs home from the supermarket, just delivered to my door as and when I need them . They do what they should; effectively clean and easy to use.",5,Positive,Positive
"Although the bottle is only 540 ml, the conditioner is very concentrated, so you only use half a capfull at a time - this means you get over 35 washes per bottle. The bottle is made of recycled plastic, and it is in turn recyclable (though not the sleeve), which is a bonus. The fuchsia smell is very pleasant, and clothes end up nice and soft. You are warned to keep the solution away from children and eyes, but this is common sense anyway. Highly recommended.",5,Positive,Positive

"I've not used a separate conditioner in years, because most washing products these days seem to do it all. I hadn't realised how much of a scent boost a separate fabric conditioner delivers, and how much it actually does soften the wash. The bottles - 6 of them, and not 8 as the ad states, come in a compact box and tbh, that itself could be used to deliver the products in, rather than having that placed in an Amazon box with more paper wrapping. All of the packaging, including the empty bottles, can be recycled. You don't waste any of the liquid, as the top of the bottle is well designed to minimise spillage and so that you can pour just what you need (half a capful is recommended, but I went with a little more), and not a gush of liquid from a large spout. I've had to dry indoors today due to the weather, and my whole house smells of this. I'm really impressed with this, and even for 6 bottles rather than the stated 8, this is good value for money. I also like that the small bottles mean that I can store them on a lower shelf for heavier items, rather than risking my under-sink shelving collapsing (yes, it's happened more than once!). Just don't squeeze the bottles hard, as they're made from recycled plastic and are a little flimsy-feeling.",4,Positive,Positive
Works well,5,Positive,Positive
Great value plenty of washes,5,Positive,Positive
"This is a more traditional scent from fabric conditioning experts Comfort. This 8 pack is highly concentrated, so you don't need to place much in the conditioner tray for it to be effective. The bottle is made from recycled plastic and itself can be recycled. A nice set of 8 bottles.",5,Positive,Positive
Washing my clothes,5,Positive,Positive
"This is a multi-pack of eight bottles of fabric softener. They are not the typical large sized bottles that I am used to, which is a bonus as they are cumbersome and tricky to store. These are half the height and fit better in the storage area in my kitchen. The softener itself has a strong, but not overpowering floral smell. Clothes come out of the wash noticeably softer after use, when compared without any. As I line dry my washing, this has been a nice addition to my laundry routine.",4,Positive,Positive
All my family have sensitive skin and perfume based softeners cause havoc with the skin and this product works brill with big and small babies alike!,5,Positive,Positive
Good,5,Positive,Positive
Great quality and super fast delivery,5,Positive,Positive
"I'm used to using the standard Comfort fabric conditioner as it's a brand I buy regularly; this concentrated version is quite impressive – with only a 15ml measure required for my modest laundry load it is economical and just as effective as the standard product. The scent is pleasant and lasting. I haven`t checked around widely for prices, but this 8 bottle pack currently works out cheaper than my local supermarket for the same product. Very happy with the results.",5,Positive,Positive

"This is a good bundle, the conditioner is really good. I do love the scent of all the conditioner, my laundry has come out clean and smelling lush. Being able to buy in bulk is great, it makes it cost effective and makes sure you always have enough in the house - this is essential in a house of teenagers, the washing machine is never off!

"LIKES - Lots of softness. The washed clothing seems remarkably pleasant to touch and feel. - The specified quantity per wash is smaller than some other conditioners, meaning that a smaller bottle gives plenty of washes. LESS LIKED - Seems to have a rather 'light' scent, when used at the advised quantities, so if you like the scent of fabric conditioners you will get less of it. CONCLUSION A decent product, which seems to work well - recommended.",4,Neutral,Positive
"Is that clean, or is that CLEAN. Nice.",5,Positive,Positive
love this one,5,Positive,Positive
"I purchased these on offer however, I was kind of shocked to see just how small they are. I know its a concentrate but is it really any more of a concentrate than the big 5litre concentrates which if you consider full price then the big tubs are so much cheaper imo",3,Neutral,Neutral

We use Persin non-bio washing liquid all the time. It is by far the best washing liquid for sensitive skin. I suffer from eczema and have tried all sorts of sensitive skin washing liquids / powder but Persil is without a doubt the best. Comfort adds a little bit of softens to the whole mix and makes the clothes softer thus easier to wear / removing the little bit of stiffness that can irritate very sensitive skin.,5,Positive,Positive
I have bought this product before and liked it so have bought some more.,5,Positive,Positive
"This is THE best night cream I have ever used. I have sensitive dry skin (slightly oily t zone) and this leaves my skin so moisturised and soft. It's very rich so a little goes alobg way, especially on hot summer nights. There's no fragrance and the ingredients are fab for anyone, not just mature skin",5,Positive,Positive
I love this product; Ive been using it for a long time and recommend it to everyone :),5,Positive,Positive
"I love this scrub, as you actually feel as though you have had a scrub. The beads are actual beads and not like some of the scrubs where you wonder if there are any beads in there? Smell is OK, but in terms of getting rid of dead skin in preparation for your products to sink in and get the full benefit, fantastic. I have been using this scrub for years now and I don't know of any other that comes close. Price is fab. I only have to use this scrub once a week, as it is so good, don't need to do it more than once. I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem. As long as its on the shelf, I'll keep buying it. Best scrub!!",5,Positive,Positive
I have been using this deodourant for 2 months I am no longer sweating. For 5 or 6 years my swearing has been out of control. Some days I would sweat through several layers and have found myself in some arkward situations. My confidence is back and I feel confident to wear tighter and more fitted clothes. Please try this product but you must give it a few days to kick in. It will make a massive difference to your life.,5,Negative,Positive

Vaseline is one of those products that has so many uses. The original scent is not a non-existent smell but its also not overpowering scent like some unscented products.

This shampoo has Silicone in and it was only when I went to my hairdressers for my usual appointment for a colour and cut, my hairdresser asked what shampoo had I used as my hair was in such bad condition and that my hair had been stripped of the colour.

My fine and a little over processed hair has long been a problem....extra body products dry it out and cause it to frizz while serums make it flat and lank.

"I was disappointed with these. The size seemed small, the 'ice cream' was a funny texture, just melted in the mouth with no substance or flavour.

"Im a Coeliac and intolerant to cows milk, and have a huge sweet tooth. Ive found some amazing vegan ice cream alternatives. Ocado sell a number of delicious ones. I also LOVE Tescos gluten and dairy free Cornettos However was super excited to try these, especially after all the amazing reviews. The tops are covered in nuts and chocolate, and the cone is thick and crispy. However none of these bits are quite enough to hide the awful taste of the ice cream. I cant even describe it as bland, as it had a flavour.... just an awful one. It was not creamy and ice cream like. It was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed the flavour from. I enjoyed eating the chocolate and nut part and the cone, and just cringed my way through the ice cream part. Cant understand all the rave reviews. The vegan Magnums however are spot on and delicious!!!",1,Negative,Negative

I was so excited to purchase this as I react to the usual dairy brands. The cone is lovely and the ice cream is nice enough to feel you are having a treat. It doesn't have the creamy feeling and texture of ice cream but near enough to eat and enjoy without any reaction! It's a little smaller than the full size cornetto but that's ok to keep the calories down. Would have liked the choc lump at the bottom of the cone. Already ordered my second box.,4,Positive,Positive
